i had a problem with my .git i pressed commit and i got message saying detached head and i lost my project, i searched on the internet for long time and i was able to get the last check back
 but after that i stopped doing commit rather i made a copy of my project at the end of each day, im really sorry for that.

thank you for this greate semester, your classes were like  youtube videos, ready to uploade without any editing :)
it was one of my best classes i had in my entire years in this collage
thank you
